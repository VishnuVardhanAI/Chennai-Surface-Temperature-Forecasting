# Chennai-Surface-Temperature-Forecasting
Time Series Analysis and Forecasting of Chennai's Surface Temperatures

This project consists of:
1. Analysis of Chennaiâ€™s surface temperature time series data to derive trends and seasonality.
2. A 3-year surface temperature forecast using Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors (SARIMAX) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models.
3. A comparison of SARIMAX and LSTM forecasts for the given data.
